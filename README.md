# LatePenaltyCalculators
Late penalty calculators in various programming languages

These programs all calculate a table of hourly late penalties that would be applied using my usual rule of a 1.08<sup>h</sup>% penalty for a submission received h hours late.

Programs in additional languages welcome by pull request.
